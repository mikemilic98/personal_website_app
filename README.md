# [Sample Running Portfolio Web Application](https://www.dhruv-mahajan.ca) 

My personal website can be used for future tempelates as required. Built using modern javascript with Node.js, React, Express, React-Router, Hot Module Reloading, Webpack and many other technologies.

## Quick Overview

In development mode run: `npm run dev`
Then open [http://localhost:7999/](http://localhost:7999/) to see your app.<br>

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, create a bundle with `npm run build`.
And I chose netlify for deployment with `netlify deploy` make sure it looks good `netlify deploy --prod`. 
Then choose `.dist` for folder to deploy
