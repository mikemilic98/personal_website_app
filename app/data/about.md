#### Intro
I am a Software Consultant and a 4th year student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UBC. My primary job functions are as a Data Engineer and Software Engineer.
<br><br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in cyber security, big-data and space. I enjoy advising/consulting companies, If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Vancouver but I am willing to travel for work.
<br><br>
#### Currently
At school and in my previous jobs, I have learned how to collaborate with people, build relationships with customers, design enterprise products, and build on-line data projects for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain medium sized web applications(NDA).
<br><br>

You can ask me in person for about personal stories because the internet is scary.
